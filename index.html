    <h2>Journal 1: The Classics of my Environment and Appeal to Emotion</h2>
      <p>
        I always remember the smells of the man-made lake by my childhood home. 
        While it may seem artificial and stinky to some, it is something that I've come to appreciate as I grow older and older. 
        The sights and sounds of the wildlife in their environment, from the ducks, to the mosquitos, to the groundhogs, and squirrels all make me reminisce about the times in that park by my home. 
        I've made so many memories there just walking around and taking in the sights and sounds, that it puts my mind at ease to think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where I am at home is where the trees are so far above my head that I cannot see the sun without finding a clearing or somewhere out on the trials where the trees grow thin. 
        The idea of spreading my arms out to touch the sky would make someone like Sappho shriek, but to me it is a feeling of agency that is impossible to describe. 
        A moment of grand power and acceptance to how marvelous it feels to be one with nature and my spirit in that moment feels whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no where I'd rather be than in the memories of my past making way through the tall trees and the dirt trials to places unknown, places unexplored by me and my family. 
        Those days of walking around the valley in Yosemite, taking in the sounds of the wildlife and smells of the pine bring me joy. 
        I had a lovely set of experiences out there with no guide, because like John Muir, I didn't need one to know where I was going. 
        It was all memorable and wonderful to young Adrian, and something I will never truly forget as long as I live. 
        Those years make me hopeful that maybe one day, I can pass along those times outdoors to my own children, or to my friends and family. 
        I miss the outdoors a lot, and I need to do more out there to feel at peace in the concrete jungle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to say that the concrete jungle we live in is not 'natural', but quite frankly it isn't even though it is constructed by and for humans. 
        There is a sufficient lack of green in the gray sprawl, a lack of trials in every direction unless you count the roads, a lack of community or self-fulfilling avenues to venture off towards, and that is not a fault of the city. 
        Maybe we all can appeal to the idea that the outdoors are not owned by one species, homo-sapiens, but is shared by all living and deceased things that once came to know the great outdoors. 
        I would like to see my home again, where the tall trees above my head make it impossible to see the sky except through their great big green net. 
        I miss the sights and the sounds of everywhere that has brought me peace, and I hope to go back one day, hopefully soon.

    <h2>Journal 2: How humans interact with their environment</h2>
      <p>
        There are certain conditions that limit humans in their approach to how they view their environment, and not all of them are
        particularly beneficial for the planet or for the psyche. Take for instance, the idea that humans are the master of the elements.
        If that were true, then why are there still unaccounted for phenomena in the world around us? Extreme weather, famine, disease? To us, 'super-ability' possessing beings, it is almost absurd to consider ourselves as 
        somewhere other than the top of the food chain because of our skills, intelligence, you name it. 
        Yet, people like Val Plumwood have shown just how ignorant that line of thinking is. Does it always have to be a near-death experience that is the one to remind us of our mortality or fragility?
        Or can we step up as a species to change the way that we consider ourselves as greater than the environment that we are apart of? Equals on all fronts to the trees, to the leaves, to the bugs in our windshield, in a perfect world there would be no prejudice or ignorance.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The illusion of mastery of our environment leaves us with certain feelings about how the world around us should react to us, rather than us to it. 
        To older lines of thinking, I'm talking ancient times, this is almost blasphemy. The world is old and our environemnt is still not fully understood by all humans on Earth, for it is so vast,
        we are simply lucky to have a general understanding in our privileged positions on Earth.
        The writings of the poets of before run with this idea of intepreting the world as a spectacle that we are simply lucky to be a part of. 
        They were not preoccupied with the idea that we are some beings who possess super-senses, or the like, but that we are here for a limited time, taking our rest and our due from the Earth but always
        giving back when we reach the end of our lives. It is impossible to fully control the elements of our environment without some degree of arrogance or ignorance. The ones before us knew this, and they took no liberties in trying to make themselves bigger than what the world offered them.

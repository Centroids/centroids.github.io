      <h2>Journal 1: The Classics of my Environment and Appeal to Emotion; Week 1</h2>
      <p> I always remember the smells of the man-made lake by my childhood home. While it may seem artificial and stinky to some, it is something that I've come to appreciate as I grow older and older. The sights and sounds of the wildlife in their environment, from the ducks, to the mosquitos, to the groundhogs, and squirrels all make me reminisce about the times in that park by my home. I've made so many memories there just walking around and taking in the sights and sounds, that it puts my mind at ease to think about it. </p>
      <p> Where I am at home is where the trees are so far above my head that I cannot see the sun without finding a clearing or somewhere out on the trials where the trees grow thin. The idea of spreading my arms out to touch the sky would make someone like Sappho shriek, but to me it is a feeling of agency that is impossible to describe. A moment of grand power and acceptance to how marvelous it feels to be one with nature and my spirit in that moment feels whole. </p>
      <p> There is no where I'd rather be than in the memories of my past making way through the tall trees and the dirt trials to places unknown, places unexplored by me and my family. Those days of walking around the valley in Yosemite, taking in the sounds of the wildlife and smells of the pine bring me joy. I had a lovely set of experiences out there with no guide, because like John Muir, I didn't need one to know where I was going. It was all memorable and wonderful to young Adrian, and something I will never truly forget as long as I live. Those years make me hopeful that maybe one day, I can pass along those times outdoors to my own children, or to my friends and family. I miss the outdoors a lot, and I need to do more out there to feel at peace in the concrete jungle. </p>
      <p> Not to say that the concrete jungle we live in is not 'natural', but quite frankly it isn't even though it is constructed by and for humans. There is a sufficient lack of green in the gray sprawl, a lack of trials in every direction unless you count the roads, a lack of community or self-fulfilling avenues to venture off towards, and that is not a fault of the city. Maybe we all can appeal to the idea that the outdoors are not owned by one species, homo-sapiens, but is shared by all living and deceased things that once came to know the great outdoors. I would like to see my home again, where the tall trees above my head make it impossible to see the sky except through their great big green net. I miss the sights and the sounds of everywhere that has brought me peace, and I hope to go back one day, hopefully soon. </p>

      <h2>Journal 2: How humans interact with their environment; Week 2</h2>
      <p> There are certain conditions that limit humans in their approach to how they view their environment, and not all of them are particularly beneficial for the planet or for the psyche. Take for instance, the idea that humans are the master of the elements. If that were true, then why are there still unaccounted for phenomena in the world around us? Extreme weather, famine, disease? To us, 'super-ability' possessing beings, it is almost absurd to consider ourselves as somewhere other than the top of the food chain because of our skills, intelligence, you name it. Yet, people like Val Plumwood have shown just how ignorant that line of thinking is. Does it always have to be a near-death experience that is the one to remind us of our mortality or fragility? Or can we step up as a species to change the way that we consider ourselves as greater than the environment that we are apart of? Equals on all fronts to the trees, to the leaves, to the bugs in our windshield, in a perfect world there would be no prejudice or ignorance. </p>
      <p> The illusion of mastery of our environment leaves us with certain feelings about how the world around us should react to us, rather than us to it. To older lines of thinking, I'm talking ancient times, this is almost blasphemy. The world is old and our environemnt is still not fully understood by all humans on Earth, for it is so vast, we are simply lucky to have a general understanding in our privileged positions on Earth. The writings of the poets of before run with this idea of intepreting the world as a spectacle that we are simply lucky to be a part of. They were not preoccupied with the idea that we are some beings who possess super-senses, or the like, but that we are here for a limited time, taking our rest and our due from the Earth but always giving back when we reach the end of our lives. It is impossible to fully control the elements of our environment without some degree of arrogance or ignorance. The ones before us knew this, and they took no liberties in trying to make themselves bigger than what the world offered them. </p>

      <h2>Journal 3: The Shield of Achilles; Week 3</h2>
      <p> The oration of Achilles' shield and the markings on it are some of the most beautiful and lengthy passages from the Iliad that are not describing the sheer brutality of the battlefield. Lined on the shield is a picture of the world as the Homer envisions it, which can then be made as a representation of all Greek civilization, or so we can presume. In the center of the shield are the stars overhead, and the detail continues to sprawl across from center onto the fringes with the plains housing wildlife, the waters of the sea, two cities (one at war and one at peace), and more. The entire shield can be described as sketch of a simplified revolving Greek world and those important elements contained within it, but it could also be Homer painting the cycle of the natural world around him, or finally, just great storytelling. There is no detail spared on the canvas (shield) made of gold that does not bear significance to a higher meaning of purpose to the Greeks, but to use it is quite a ways foreign. The stars overhead are no longer as easily visible as once before, and the world around us is infinitely more civilized and complex than during the time of the ancient poets, but we can still put ourselves in their shoes. To the master orator Homer the significance of Greek Environmentalism was to relate that picture of nature back to the listener as similes, metaphors, or hyperbole in his epic. </p>
      <p> An example is the length of detail to which Homer narrates the scenes on the shield. If you count the paragraph number, it's around 9 to describe the shield a whole ways round. There are oxen and there are lions and the fields of corn harvested by sickle adorned on the shield. You could say the stars in the center represent the Greek Deities and what is life all around it. However, it's important to remember that romanticism of the natural world is a continent away still by this time and a fairly recent idea. Moreover, Homer used the natural world as a way of storytelling. The moly plant in the Odyssey is an antidote for our hero Ulysses, taking inspiration from an actual plant that Homer may or may not have known existed. For whatever the conclusion maybe, nature in Homer's time was not an ally, but a force to be conquered and toiled over. </p>

      <h2>Journal 4: Greek Instrumentalism and Human Instrumentalism today; Week 4</h2>
      <p> Christian teachings show us the distinct attitude of domination over nature as a sort of natural right that human beings possess over god's world. The aftermath of our development, cultivation and culture is not addressed in god's teachings, yet it is not something that we can feign ignorance too in the face of global catastrophe with the destruction of the world's ecology. The perverse thought that humans can take, and only take from the Earth without giving back to the planet is an old form of thinking, in line with the prominent view that humans are the master cultivators and benefactors of nature. </p>
      <p> To go against the teachings of god and put the needs of the Earth first was heresy just up until a few decades ago, and those who did put the Earth first were labelled as naturalists or extremists who should be ignored. Take for instance, the veiled propaganda around Hetch-Hetchy dam set forth by Pinchot and Phelan. They claimed that the inundation of the valley that John Muir sought to protect was the cheapest and easiest solution to solving the problem of water supply to San Francisco. By appealing to the ideas of man's rule over nature in terms of civilized progress, the conservation effort is reduced to a sort of utopian ideal where nature is considered before the needs of citizens. The destruction of a natural landmark took place under the guise of development to benefit a nation. We now can look back on that decision to flood Hetch Hetchy as one of arrogance, and of a futile lack of understanding of how to care for our natural world without destroying it. </p>
      <p> The Greeks thought as well that instrumentalization was the peak of civilization, and even Odysseus orates about those Cyclopes who fail to take advantage of a plentiful island for cultivation as a fool's errand. The same ideas exist today when we consider the capitalist system we live in today, where the idea is to do things cheaper, better, and for more profit. These tenets are at odds with respecting our natural environment because eventually, something has to give, and it is usually the land and animals on Earth that cannot speak back. </p>

      <h2>Journal 5: Gardens, Paradiso, and Naturalized "Re-creation"; Week 5 Greek Utopianism</h2>
      <p> Persian paradiso, or the garden of the gods was created for man's dominion of the natural world, beginning from elements taken from Eastern civilizations like the Persians. It was a sign of humility and intelligence to curate your garden and to rule over it as master of it, almost analogous to how Persian kings were given rule over man by the gods, and now have rule of nature provided by the gods as well. </p>
      <p> The garden of the gods can have two or more meanings to the modern man. There are first the gardens of the world that are cultivated for the purpose of honoring our deities or traditions. An example of this is can be seen in the form of a buddhist sanctuary or the grand gardens of the Persians, who in in a way allows us to be the gods of our own universe. We are as gardeners possess a purpose to honor the living things that we consider to be dear to us, green or not. Our gardens are tended with urgency and care, for recklessness and apathy bring us not reward for our efforts. This garden of the gods is at ends with and other type of that same garden presented by Theocritus in the myth of the 5 races.</p>
      <p> Consider the entire earth to be this garden of the gods. To the unbound mind, the entire earth could be considered to the this garden, for there is no In the myth by Theocritus, there are races of material that descend from the 1st, all the way to the 5th. Gold turns to Silver, which is lesser than Gold but greater than Bronze. Silver turns to Bronze, of lesser value than Silver but still greater than that of Ash. Bronze turns to Ash, and from Ash comes the race of Demi-gods before the modern man. The race of man that we homo sapiens are a part of feature no blessings from the gods other than that we inherit the Earth for our own advancement. </p>

      <h2>Journal 6 Week 6: Hike to Mori Point *Activity* Visitation </h2>
      <p> The sights and sounds of the crashing waves. Their awesome power turning rock into sand, a perpetual roar heard canyons over time after time again. There is nothing greater than the sounds of the ocean. The titanic power of the sea and its ability to rip through rock, to carve through the earth, and to sustain an entire ocean of life above and below its waters. </p>
      <p> The water and air in Pacifica are cold and stinging. There is not much cover between myself and the sea on this muddy and rocky trail. I have only a pair of faded jeans and a thin long sleeve to provide me protection from the wind and ocean. Yet I feel at home. Even with the clouds providing no sun, and a gentle incline that soon becomes harsh to make my feet hurt, this visitation to Mori Point feels no different than when I was a child. I remember climbing endless steps just like the bootleggers trail to reach the top of the Mist Trail in Yosemite for the awesome view above of the water coming over the cliff, and the feeling of powerlessness as the mist and stream hit against my skin. And yet I had no fear, I was at home. </p>
      <p> It is the same feeling here by the carved cliff faces on Pacifica beach, where I am just an unsubstantial speck of life here on this rock, attempting to make my way to the top and to take in the view of the world below. There is no handholding, no cement trail to give me traction on the muddy incline, there is only a heavily worn trail and the soles of my shoes to keep me on course, along with the indominable human spirit of someone who wants to reach the top. As I approach ever closer. I come to understand myself and the will to be a part of nature even more. I understand the idea behind preserving the environment not just for our own enjoyment, but for the cultivation of all life on this planet, above and below the surface of the waves. </p>
      <p> And when I reach the top, I am taken in by the beautiful views of the surrounding below. It drives me to want to reach the world below the waves, and to appreciate the beauty of the world as we have inherited it, but with the intention of making it better for those of us who will come at some point in the future to appreciate it themselves. I am hopeful to do more visitations to the surronding of where I live, not because the landscape is beautiful (though that plays a part), but because it brings me ever closer to home, and a place of understanding inside myself. That maybe human beings can save one another, rather than put out their hands to crush. </p>

      <h2>Journal 7 Week 6: Roman Utopianism</h2>
      <p>Roman Utopianism featured certain elements to the appreciation and cultivation of nature as a form of recreation or as a way to form a connection between a third middle landscape that bridged the urban and the wilderness of ancient times, this third pastoral zone for Utopian ideals. Virgil's Eclogues features instructions to the cultivation of farmland in the pastoral zone, as a means of potentially furthering Roman instrumentalism over the natural earth but more over to show an appreciation for the Roman pastoral zone in nature. The urban environments for the Romans were frequently busy and so consumed with culture that a willingness to find an ideal natural world occurred in the outskirts or the provinces of Rome. This pastoral revolution to the cultivation of farmland culture or homestead living as a means of rest and relaxation is mirrored to show the changing American mindset of outdoor recreation and value to the human spirit in Western Romanticism. </p>
      <p>Compositions that could be called love letters to the natural world in the 21st century consist of Virgil's Georgics among other works such as City Mouse Country Mouse by Horace where the pastoral zone is an alleged place of sanctity and the counter culture proposal of split between the pastoral, wilderness, and urban environments of Rome are characterized by a cute mice and their respective homes. One in the countryside and the other in the city. The allusions and ideas preached by Roman authors such as Virgil to the idea of power in the Roman pastoral zone is one that cannot be understated in the influx of culture from the provinces into Rome. With a less clandestine understanding or instrumentalist view of the natural world on Earth, Roman utopianism can be celebrated for its advancements in cultivating a defense for the natural world.  </p>
      <p>The consolidation of gardens in the Roman home away from the more hospitality oriented front end sections of Roman homes is also a mirror into the idea of a utopian garden more that is more commonly seen in the East and South in the Persian and Greek colonies respectively. The construction of garden spaces in the home as a means to enjoy a perfect encapsulation of nature is also seen in the lack of wall decoration or decorations surrounding the natural world. Compositions of nature were more limited to the imperial classes who could commission more esoteric pieces such as full panorama's of 3rd Century Roman wall art in Pompeii in one of the Villa Julia's where the surrounding picture is off an overgrown Roman garden. A controlled natural environment in the pastoral zone and the cultivation of small scale gardens of Rome points to the birth of a Utopian ideal for nature as another facet of life to attempt to control and master, rather than let run free. </p>

      <h2>Journal 8 Week 7: Roman Instrumentalism</h2>
      <p>To cultivate the Earth can be seen as one of the most rewarding prospects in all of the Roman world because of the natural order of dominion where it is man who rules over the Earth and should try to cultivate the Earth for a greater success at survival. This idea is seen in the Greek Instrumentalist movement where certain mythology heroes like Odysseus cast judgement at the prospect of a potential oasis of culture remaining uncultivated because of lack of caring in regards to one of the islands that the Cyclopes surrounds. Authors like Virgil were commissioned to create pieces of art for the imperial household usually as a means to control the materials presented to the public. Virgils Georgics were distributed because of their heavy handed instructions into the attempting to convince the public in the meaning of cultivating your own farmland and how to begin instrumentalizing for yourself. Funnily enough it is the author's perspective on farmland beginnings and not one of a farmer's perspective in the Georgics, so the material can also be thought of as one the first looks into the Romantic movement of nature as well with all the pretty writing about the nature. "And when the fresh leaves bud in their early youth" (Virgil Georgics 2.362-370). </p>
      <p>It was the common thought that if you were not planting or engaging in culture yourself on the farmland or on the pastoral front, that you were not in fact reaping the full benefits of the Earth. Those who let their fields fall fallow would be doomed to never reap the harvests of the Earth again. Even though it was laborious work to sustain farmland in ancient times, the fruit born from the process would serve as a reward for the sustained efforts of cutting the Earth. Funnily enough, it is through authors like Pliny where we see cases of certain judgements of the allotments of land for use other than the benefit of the public. In Natural History, Pliny writes that during the early days of the Roman kings, a citizen was granted two jugera of land and that was considered sufficient in comparison to the more recent displeasure in small land allocations by those on the lowest position of the Roman totem pole, the perspective of the slaves of Emperor Nero being discontent with only, "And yet, at the present day, men who but lately were the slaves of the Emperor Nero have been hardly content with pleasure-gardens that occupied the same space as this; while they must have fishponds, forsooth, of still greater extent, and in some instances I might add, perhaps, kitchens even as well." (Pliny Natural History 18.2.6-7 Line 6). Roman and Greek instrumentalization pioneered the efforts of the more dominant school of thought in regards to the cultivation and profiteering of the Earth's resources for the benefit of humankind, and this belief is widespread and believed fully by regions of the world today. </p>

      <h2>Journal 9 Week 7: Park Merced *Activity* Violation</h2>
      <p>Reclaiming the natural world for myself, specifically areas now tied to previous engagements where the energy of the surrounding has changed, has proven to be a fulfilling and at the same time, frustrating experience. The movement of ones self through a pretty natural environment where the trees, ambience, and the light all around are seen through the retina and felt in heart are usually therapuatic, or a cheerful backdrop for the more advanced cultural and social engagements of our preoccupation. Sitting there in the center of the Juan Bautista circle engaging in a cold sweat on a cold day, I sit and wonder why it is only the natural world as a moving and living picture that can heal most people or in my case, make me feel worse about situations. The engagement of walking through Park Merced with its green sidewalks and same appearance homes prompts feelings of sadness from a time before the pandemic around the world, and a closer loss of understanding between the personal surroundings held dear to me like places of nature and my own self. The expectance of an action of culture occurring in nature such as seeing someone I remember from long ago greeting me, remembering the past about that place, or seeing something that excites me brings me the most frustrating experiences with the natural world, because I feel like a bystander away from it rather than as a part of it. </p>
      <p>The foreign feeling of being tied in a place in time where you feel sick about the past can be rid through increased exposure to the location, and continuing to accept the past and that Park Merced will continue to shrink in the future as further land developments and necessities of culture take place around us, I remember that it is important to appreciate and catalogue the efforts to re-immerse ourselves in the natural world as something that doesn't happen in one effort alone. That it is continued appreciation and admiration of the natural world that allows for the enrichment of the soul and for the feelings of being in a place of fear, especially one where there should be no culture but now paradoxically is the site of some because of prior history, where that energy can be channeled into an appreciation for nature and the chaos around us. I do not look forward to the day that nature does not provide its soothing experience on me. Maybe it is because of my upbringing in the national and manmade parks, or viewpoints of the authors that I've read that I have these experiences with the natural world, but it is what it is, and I've managed to reframe the cultural significance of certain zones in the natural world into an appreciation for nature and the everchanging seasons. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Journal 10 Week 9: Roman Environmentalism</h2>
      <p>The movement from the orchestration of the natural world from three biomes of the urban, the pastoral, and the wild became challenged in the Roman world in regards to the ideas of man's association with nature of man's perceived dominion over the natural world. Man meaning every person here. The Roman push for environmentalism can be characterized by the interest or change in ideals towards cultivation of only the necessary from the Earth and respect of the sanctity of nature, as shown in works by authors such as Virgil or Ovid in their tales of Aeneas and Erysichthon respectively where messages of diligence, selflessness, and respect are used to describe nature in story or the personifications of nature. The environmentalist movement in Rome on the whole is one that would've had to had survived scrutiny and oversight from imperial eyes, and at least in Virgil's case, survives by way of administration over the art commissioned by the imperial household. In this case, the release of material commissioned by Augustus produced by Virgil posthumously. </p>
      <p>Compared to the prior thinking around the uses of the natural world and the needs of the people surrounding those resources, Roman environmentalism points a shift in the line of thinking in regards to the acceptance of the use of nature for something other than the pastoral or to instrumentalize. Though the ideas of doing things for the benefit of nature as a means to benefit yourself is not new in our modern era, it was not characterized in history until much later. The lamentation of using too much of the Earth here in the surviving classical literature is a change from the culture around the pastoral and the perceived 'nature' there, where it is controlled and not necessarily a protected piece of land like we consider today to be 'nature'. It seems that the first ideas of a mother nature at least in the Western world if we do not consider the works of the Eastern civilizations appears in Rome around this time period of Roman environmentalism where a light version of protecting the environment or at least beginning to understand humankind's impact on the environment begins to be documented in history.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Journal 11 Week 10; Animal Ethics</h2>
      <p>Ethics around the treatment of animals from surviving ancient civilizations is in media ranging from fiction to theology, and features many of the same personifications of nature which can be interpreted as a defense for the natural world depending on the sources considered. Of the fictional pieces, Homer's the Odyssey is picked at by Plutarch in the story of Gryllus, which features the hero being cornered on his position of believing that animals are lesser on the rung to mortal man with an animal of Ceres who prefers the animal lifestyle. Even though the Olympian is renowned for his cunning and wisdom to change the position of the animal minds, Plutarch has written them in such a way that they are content with being animals in her garden, and that it is man who is the one who lives in a way that breeds discontent through the consumption and abandonment of the goods of the Earth. Animal rights in the ancient sources like the story of Gryllus illustrate a change in the perspective from just the uses of nature for mankind to a more refined defense of the natural world for the purposes of affecting the world because it cannot be defended for itself. </p>
      <p>Animals impact their environment to a much lesser degree than mankind does, and this was already understood during the time of Plutarch around the 2nd century CE and reasoned for in his work, Moralia "On the Eating of Flesh". The ideas that certain creatures have free will to do the things they please and that this then makes those who consume the meat of animals impure is an idea casted by Plutarch, that he cannot damn a man who chooses not to feed on the meat of animals because the action itself is one of gore when you consume the flesh of something else. It is the idea of a higher reasoning for the animal that cannot defend itself among other new advocates for a nature first approach that allow for these more liberal ideas to take hold. Animals can provide us with connection to our environment through their co-inhabitation of the places that we also exist within in our modern world and in nature. The parks of the West would not be complete if they were completely desolate and soulless places to walk among. They are filled with life that cannot be mirrored anywhere else and provide those who choose to access those bubbles of natural reserves a chance to appreciate and nurture the love for animals and by sheer coincidence, the environment on the whole too. </p>

      <h2>Journal 12 Week 11; Culture Contact</h2>
      <p>When the emissaries of the Old World arrived in the New World, they carried the writings of the great Roman and Greek authors alongside them because they were well educated and cultured individuals. Certain New World expeditioners like Cristoforo Columbo state that the natural world around them adhered to a much different shape compared to the world described in the ancient texts by authors such as Ptolemy. In his mind with the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean, there is a concavity from the circular form of the Earth that protrudes in the shape of a nipple on a ball that more than likely just pertains to the open sea of nothingness that spans around the planet in the form of the ocean. Others in later history who travel following the words of those ancient figureheads encounter scenarios where the writing disagrees with the real world experiences of those who are there to encounter them. Jose de Acosta, expected to find extreme heat near the equator because of the writings of Aristotle, but quickly learned the opposite in his own lived experience. "For when I passed the Equator... in March, I felt so cold that I was forced to go into the sun to warm myself. What could I do then but laugh at Aristotle's Meteorology and his philosophy." (Jose de Acosta Natural and Moral History of the Indies 1590 Line 3-4). In regards to the new world, prior proven European ideas fell short in explaining the encounters of the new landscapes along the Americas.  </p>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>Ultimately, the natural world and the Classics are intertwined in their introduction of the first ideas of the Romantic movement, Environmentalism, and understanding of nature as place to heal and cultivate the soul in the Western world. Nature beginning with the Book of Genesis is to be conquered and ruled over with scrutiny but this idea has only been recently challenged. Humans are taught to mercilessly work the Earth of its goods for the purpose of propagating the human race and to spread the word of the fallen figures who have granted them this playground to cultivate, Earth. The forefathers to the Romantic movement in Classical literature are the authors who write of nature in terms of a defense for the misunderstood and misrepresented beings that coinhabit to the planet along with humans. The natural world is to be appreciated and while thoughts on what the ultimate purpose of nature means to a greater populace is still highly opinionated, the belief that the significance of nature overrides any veto for it to be of enough importance to be taught in schools speaks volumes. For most of history the blind have followed those whose light is illuminating for all figures, and standing on the shoulders of giants we build the ideas to challenge prior convictions or faiths about the natural world.</p>
      <p>Before speaking of the Romantic movement, I interpreted the associations of nature in a positive light which is seen in the contemporary to be associated with the classical literature sources, but quickly learned that these ideas which challenge the widespread beliefs of yesteryear were in fact more recent introduced in the American homeland, but have origins in Ancient Greece and Rome. The works we have to analyze today from ancient sources most of which from the western perspective, offer a timeline into the changing perspective of man's place in between a harmonious or equally dissonant relationship between people and nature. The Romantic movement and it's writings of the western landscape feature similar tones of awe and grandeur to those written of the locations around the Mediterranean cultures. Seeing the differences between the Greek and Roman sources and then the later Western sources offered a complete view into the very recent history of natural preservation.  </p>
      <p>On the whole, I am better for having taken the course because of an appreciation for the chaotic wilderness that I cannot control but take much satisfaction in protecting and cultivating in my own way. The natural world can teach so much to the singular individual as well as community about their own self that it must be taught everywhere, regardless of where the information came from or from who it spawned from. Problematic authors and material will always exist where there is a breakthrough in the held opinion, but we can learn and restructure the ideas that benefit us most from their problematic beginnings. The Western Romantic movement is an understated phenomena of love and appreciation for the landscape to which we call home here in the Americas. Almost everything in the old world was conquered and molded by man to suit their needs. Nature was already culled in the East by the time of the Romantic movements in the West thanks to old world ideas surrounding the longevity of the Earth's resources for man to use in his quest for righteousness. Environmentalism, the romantic movement, and nature as part of the psyche all contain origins within Ancient Greece and Rome, but were fully expanded upon and realized by the great ecological thinkers of the past centuries from the Western Front.  </p>
      <p>I take pride in understanding the origins of the Romantic movement in the US with the appreciation for the frontier and designated spots of wilderness in ancient times as well. This was also talked about during the class with the movement towards a pastoral zone for Roman appreciation of nature, but that features the more heavy handed elements of culture which involves agriculture, politics, and the petty issues of the people who were alive at the time. During this time period of Roman Utopianism the purposes of nature were to serve as land for potential cultivation or with some use similar. The more modern ideal of leaving natural sites in their original configurations is something that has only become more popular today with the Romantic movement, but was not a common idea in the times of yesteryear. Nature in the regards to the Classical interpretation of for the good and benefit for mankind is not something that can be easily proven due to other more malignant philosophies surrounding the same subject by other Classicizing material like the Book of Genesis. It can however, be proven by personal experience and feeling of elation within the soul as written about in the Romantic movement and proven through the experiences provided by the course. </p>
      <p>The Western United States and its export of the love for the natural world in its rawest form is a simple but difficult idea to contain as it has the potential for many potential facets of disagreement among people. Seeing the instrumentalization of the ancient world and then to have real world nearby examples provided such as John Muir's defense for Hetch-Hetchy Dam open the figurative levy of potentially placing the natural world and its needs above those of the people who take hold in a certain area, reason withstanding. That last difference of only accepting the desecration of nature because of extenuating circumstances is what separates the Western Naturalist view of the green world around us, and the passages of literature from some centuries ago that give us permission the express permission to take more than necessary of the Earth. From my own experiences outside with Nature where the intersection of culture is much less perceived, I am able to heal and accept the Western Romantic view as one I accept as my own, not as one that was taught down and molded for me. Something that I molded for myself rather than take another's word for it like the great author's advocate the young should do, to find experience and agency within the natural world and teach its preservation to the next generation of people's after our own. </p>
